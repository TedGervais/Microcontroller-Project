# Microcontroller-Project
A basic microcontroller created with a teammate in my Computer Architecture Class. 
Files include a basic write-up on how the controller was designed and tested. I
designed the Register File, Program Counter and ID/EXE pipeline, while my partner 
designed the ALU. The microcontroller runs on a MIPS style instruction set, with 
a 16-bit opcode.
